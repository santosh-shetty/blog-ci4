This detail was at the root of many issues and the main reason why CodeIgniter 3 has a completely re-written Session library.</p><p>Why are we telling you this? Because it is likely that after trying to find the reason for your performance issues, you may conclude that locking is the issue and therefore look into how to remove the locks …</p><p>DO NOT DO THAT! Removing locks would be&nbsp;<strong>wrong</strong>&nbsp;and it will cause you more problems!</p><p>Locking is not the issue, it is a solution. Your issue is that you still have the session open, while you’ve already processed it and therefore no longer need it. So, what you need is to close the session for the current request after you no longer need it.</p>', '2023-03-24', '14:27:46', 'The Session class permits you to maintain a user’s “state” and track their activity while they browse your site.', 'Web Develop'),

Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered \"static\" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content and may require basic website design skills and software. Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as a&nbsp;<em>classic website</em>, a&nbsp;<em>five-page website</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>brochure website</em>&nbsp;are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include information about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.</p><p>Static websites may still use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_side_include\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">server side includes</a>&nbsp;(SSI) as an editing convenience, such as sharing a common menu bar across many pages.

For example, when the front page of a news site is requested, the code running on the webserver might combine stored HTML fragments with news stories retrieved from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">database</a>&nbsp;or another website via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">RSS</a>&nbsp;to produce a page that includes the latest information. Dynamic sites can be interactive by using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_forms\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">HTML forms</a>, storing and reading back&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookies\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">browser cookies</a>, or by creating a series of pages that reflect the previous history of clicks. Another example of dynamic content is when a retail website with a database of media products allows a user to input a search request, e.g. for the keyword&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatles\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">Beatles</a>. In response, the content of the Web page will spontaneously change the way it looked before, and will then display a list of Beatles products like CDs, DVDs, and books.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">Dynamic HTML</a>&nbsp;uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);\">JavaScript</a>&nbsp;code to instruct the Web browser how to interactively modify the page contents. One way to simulate a certain type of dynamic website while avoiding the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection basis is to periodically automatically regenerate a large series of static pages.</p>', '2023-04-04', '13:58:14', 'A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.', 'Website');
